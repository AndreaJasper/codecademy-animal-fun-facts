# codecademy-animal-fun-facts
In this project, we’ll build a program that allows users to click an animal on the screen in order to have a fun fact pop up.

Our program will:
- Display a selection of animals on the screen
- Allow users to decide if they  want to include a background or not
- Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options
- The selected fact will pop up on the screen
- As we keep clicking, we’ll be able to see different facts
